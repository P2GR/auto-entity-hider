# Auto Entity Hider

Auto Entity Hider automatically switches hide settings based on where you are.

- In enabled regions/minigames, it uses your **Inside Regions** hide settings.
- Everywhere else, it uses your **Outside Regions** hide settings.

This lets you keep one profile for raids/minigames and another profile for normal gameplay.

## Supported areas

- Tombs of Amascut: Lobby, Akkha (Puzzle/Boss), Baba (Puzzle/Boss), Kephri (Puzzle/Boss), Zebak (Puzzle/Boss), Wardens (P1/P2), Wardens (P3/P4), Reward
- Theatre of Blood: Maiden, Bloat, Nylocas, Sotetseg, Xarpus, Verzik, Reward
- Chambers of Xeric: Olm (more rooms added soon...)
- Minigames: Wintertodt (Boss/Bank), Tempoross (Boss/Lobby), Guardians of the Rift
- Locations: Grand Exchange

## Quick setup

1. Enable the areas you want in the plugin settings.
2. Set your **Hide Config (Inside Regions)** options.
3. Optionally set different **Hide Config (Outside Regions)** options.

## Notes

- This plugin handles entity hiding itself and conflicts with the default Entity Hider plugin.
- If an area toggle is off, the plugin treats it as outside and applies your outside settings.
